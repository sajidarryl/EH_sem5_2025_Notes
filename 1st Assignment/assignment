Create Low-Privilege User
Methodology
To set up a secure system, I created a new user account student01 with limited privileges. The task was carried
out entirely via terminal using Linux user management commands:
• adduser to create the account.
• usermod to ensure the user had no sudo/admin rights.
• groups and /etc/passwd to verify the user's access level.

Findings
The user student01 was successfully created.
Verified that student01 was not in the sudo group.
The /etc/passwd file showed the default shell and home directory were correctly set.
student01:x:1001:1001::/home/student01:/bin/bash
Permissions were restricted — student01 couldn’t run commands with sudo.
Conclusions
Creating users without admin rights enforces the Principle of Least Privilege, which:
• Reduces attack surface.
• Prevents accidental system misconfigurations.
• Enhances overall system security by compartmentalizing permissions.
This is especially critical in penetration testing labs and shared environments like Kali VM.
